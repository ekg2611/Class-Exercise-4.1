The Visual Basic program that this was derived from uses a CSV file for the
journal store.  Thus, the .fif files are human readable and can easily be
worked with.

Before the fif file is loaded, however, a MS Access database is created by the
VB application.  The database will be put into a \temp directory within the
application install directory.  The default password is 'yoda'.

Both the Accounts and the Funds were exported from MS Access in XML format,
after which the XML files were converted to a slightly more condensed format
using AccountsTransform.xsl and FundsTransform.xsl which are provided in this
directory.
